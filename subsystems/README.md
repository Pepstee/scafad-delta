# Subsystems

This directory contains specialized subsystem modules that provide additional functionality to the SCAFAD Delta system.

## Overview

The `subsystems` folder houses modular components that extend the core system with specialized capabilities for auditing, privacy management, quality monitoring, schema management, and semantic analysis.

## Contents

- **audit_trail_generator.py** - Comprehensive audit trail generation and management
- **privacy_policy_engine.py** - Privacy policy enforcement and management engine
- **quality_monitor.py** - Data quality monitoring and assessment tools
- **schema_registry.py** - Schema registration, versioning, and management
- **semantic_analyzer.py** - Semantic analysis and content understanding tools

## Architecture

Subsystems are designed as:
- Independent modules with clear interfaces
- Pluggable components that can be enabled/disabled
- Extensible frameworks for custom implementations
- Integration points with external systems

## Usage

### Enabling Subsystems
Subsystems can be enabled through configuration:
```python
from configs.layer1_config import enable_subsystems

enable_subsystems(['audit', 'privacy', 'quality'])
```

### Custom Subsystem Development
New subsystems can be developed by:
1. Implementing the required interface
2. Registering with the subsystem manager
3. Configuring integration points
4. Adding to the test suite

## Subsystem Interfaces

Each subsystem implements:
- Standard initialization interface
- Configuration management
- Error handling and logging
- Performance monitoring hooks

## Integration

Subsystems integrate with:
- Core Layer 1 modules
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring
- External data sources

## Configuration

Subsystem behavior is controlled through:
- Configuration files in `configs/` directory
- Environment variables
- Runtime configuration updates
- Policy-based rules
